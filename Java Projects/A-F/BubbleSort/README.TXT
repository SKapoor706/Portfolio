PROJECT TITLE: Bubblesort

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: The objective was to truly understand the sorting algorithm known as bubblesorting by creating the bubblesort algorithm from scratch and making the program snatch data from a .txt seperate file, use the data as input, sort the data with the bubblesort, and create a seperate .txt file to place the sorted data. Also, in order to study the concept of time complexity, the program also return data that showed the length of time for the computer to process the program. 

VERSION or DATE: May 2015

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: ----DISCLAIMER---- Since this program used specific file directories, it cannot work without the specified files.
