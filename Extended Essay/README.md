What is the significance of the extended essay?

The extended essay provides:

- practical preparation for undergraduate research
- an opportunity for students to investigate a topic of special interest to them, which is also related to one of the student's six DP subjects. 

Through the research process for the extended essay, students develop skills in:

- formulating an appropriate research question
- engaging in a personal exploration of the topic
- communicating ideas
- developing an argument. 
- Participation in this process develops the capacity to analyse, synthesize and evaluate knowledge.

In my extended essay, my research question is "In a simulated computer network environment, to what extent are protocols for computer networks used to transfer packets of data between multiple devices?"

In the document titled "EE-0019AIbrahim", it includes the finalized copy of the extended essay, and the other document includes a log for my research over the summer.
