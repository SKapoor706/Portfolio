PROJECT TITLE: Multiplication_Machine

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: The purpose was to practice the concepts of loops, such as the "while, elif, else" loop, and functions, while interacting with the user. With the power of loops, I am able to take and integer from user input and multiply itself by the numbers that come before it. For example, if the user inputs the number "4", then the output of the program of would be 24 because 4*3*2*1 = 24.
