PROJECT TITLE: DistToLine

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: The purpose of this project was to be able to calculate the distance from a point (a, b) to a line given by equation Ax + By + C = 0. The formula giving this distance is a standard one from analytic geometry. Also, this project allowed me to practice programming without constructors or objects.

VERSION or DATE: November 2014

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Use the .java files in a java compiler
